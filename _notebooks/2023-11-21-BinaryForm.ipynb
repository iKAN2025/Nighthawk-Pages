Although the code doesn't directly deal with binary numbers or operations, it helps in understanding how binary choices (true/false, on/off) are applied in programming as binary flags to control various features or states within an application. Understanding binary principles aids in comprehending the foundational concepts used in programming, regardless of the programming language or domain.\n","\n","\n"," # Flowchart\n","![life.png](/Nighthawk-Pages/images/binary5.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"vscode":{"languageId":"html"}},"outputs":[{"ename":"SyntaxError","evalue":"invalid syntax (3926777161.py, line 1)","output_type":"error","traceback":["\u001b[0;36m  Cell \u001b[0;32mIn[1], line 1\u001b[0;36m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;31m    <!-- HTML structure remains the same -->\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m    ^\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;31mSyntaxError\u001b[0m\u001b[0;31m:\u001b[0m invalid syntax\n"]}],"source":["<!-- HTML structure remains the same -->\n","\n","<script>\n","  // JavaScript to handle binary features (id)\n","  const completedExerciseCheckbox = document.getElementById('completedExercise');\n","  const restDayCheckbox = document.getElementById('restDay');\n","  const favoriteExerciseCheckbox = document.getElementById('favoriteExercise');\n","  const warmupCompletedCheckbox = document.getElementById('warmupCompleted');\n","  const cooldownCompletedCheckbox = document.getElementById('cooldownCompleted');\n","\n","  // Event listeners for checkboxes\n","  completedExerciseCheckbox.addEventListener('change', () => {\n","    // Check if both \"Rest Day\" and \"Completed Exercise\" are checked\n","    if (restDayCheckbox.checked && completedExerciseCheckbox.checked) {\n","      // If both are checked, uncheck \"Completed Exercise\" checkbox\n","      completedExerciseCheckbox.checked = false;\n","      alert('You cannot mark both \"Rest Day\" and \"Completed Exercise\" on the same day.');\n","    }\n","  });\n","\n","  restDayCheckbox.addEventListener('change', () => {\n","    // Check if both \"Rest Day\" and \"Completed Exercise\" are checked\n","    if (restDayCheckbox.checked && completedExerciseCheckbox.checked) {\n","      // If both are checked, uncheck \"Completed Exercise\" checkbox\n","      completedExerciseCheckbox.checked = false;\n","      alert('You cannot mark both \"Rest Day\" and \"Completed Exercise\" on the same day.');\n","    }\n","  });\n","\n","</script>\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.4"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
