Although the code doesn't directly deal with binary numbers or operations, it helps in understanding how binary choices (true/false, on/off) are applied in programming as binary flags to control various features or states within an application. Understanding binary principles aids in comprehending the foundational concepts used in programming, regardless of the programming language or domain."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["#
