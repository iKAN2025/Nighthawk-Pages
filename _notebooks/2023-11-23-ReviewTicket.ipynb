    "Explanation of Code: \n",
    "\n",
    "### Logic Gate Functions\n",
    "- `andGate(input1, input2)` and `orGate(input1, input2)` simulate the AND and OR logic gates.\n",
    "- They take two binary inputs and return the result based on the gate's logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `generateLogicGateChallenge()` Function\n",
    "- Dynamically generates challenge items for each logic gate (AND and OR).\n",
    "- Creates elements for labels, input fields for binary values, and a \"Check Answer\" button for each gate.\n",
    "- The event listener attached to the button handles user input, checks it against the expected gate operation, and provides feedback on correctness or prompts for valid inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Interaction and Challenges\n",
    "- For each logic gate (AND and OR), challenge items are created consisting of:\n",
    "  - A label indicating the type of gate operation (AND or OR).\n",
    "  - Two input fields for users to input binary values (0 or 1).\n",
    "  - A \"Check Answer\" button to verify the user's input against the logic gate operation.\n",
    "- Upon clicking the \"Check Answer\" button:\n",
    "  - It validates user inputs, checks if they're valid binary values, and compares them against the expected output of the corresponding logic gate.\n",
    "  - If the user's inputs match the expected gate operation, it provides an alert indicating correctness. Otherwise, it alerts the user to try again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Enhancements\n",
    "- Progress tracking or badge awards can be added upon correct answers.\n",
    "- Styling enhancements or additional gate types can be included to expand the challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code provides a basic implementation of a binary logic gates challenge where users interact by inputting binary values and verifying their correctness against predefined logic gate operations (AND and OR).\n",

    "## Binary Music\n",
    "[Link to Project](https://jplip.github.io/frontTri2/music/)\n",
    "![challenge.png](/Nighthawk-Pages/images/music.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### User Instructions\n",
    "- A `<div>` with `id=\"instructions\"` provides user instructions:\n",
    "  - It includes headings and paragraphs explaining how the tool works.\n",
    "  - Instructions guide users on inputting binary patterns and understanding the representation of '0's and '1's.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Field and Button\n",
    "- An `<input>` field with `type=\"text\"` and an associated label allows users to input binary patterns.\n",
    "- A `<button>` with an `onclick` event triggers the `composeMusic()` function to generate the musical composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JavaScript Functions\n",
    "- `composeMusic()`:\n",
    "  - Triggered by the \"Compose Music\" button, it generates a musical composition based on the entered binary pattern.\n",
    "- `noteToFrequency(note)`:\n",
    "  - Maps musical notes ('C4', 'D4', etc.) to their respective frequencies using a predefined `notesMap`.\n",
    "  - Returns the frequency of a given note.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Audio Generation\n",
    "- Uses the Web Audio API to generate sound.\n",
    "- Creates an `AudioContext` and an `Oscillator` for sound wave production.\n",
    "- For each character (bit) in the binary sequence:\n",
    "  - If '0', sets the oscillator frequency with `noteToFrequency()` and creates a short note.\n",
    "  - If '1', introduces a brief silence by advancing time without playing notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note Duration and Delay\n",
    "- `noteDuration` and `noteDelay` variables control the duration of each note and delay between notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code interprets a binary sequence input with '0's as musical notes and '1's as brief silences, generating a musical composition accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Improvements: I wish I could have added more to the Binary Music Tracker\n",
