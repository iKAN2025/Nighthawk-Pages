    "\n",
    "I noticed the passwords were hashed when stored in the backend, so I became curious about binary hashing. \n",

    "Steps in Binary Password Hashing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: The user provides a password.\n",
    "Hashing: The password is processed through a cryptographic hash function.\n",
    "Binary Output: The result is a binary string (a series of 0s and 1s) that represents the hashed password.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-256 or MD5, takes as input a set of binary data (typically as bytes) and gives output that is hopefully unique for each set of possible inputs. We use cryptographic hashing.\n",

    "We may implement a reminder system using a binary countdown. For instance, we can represent the time left until the next workout session using a binary countdown clock, where each bit represents a unit of time (hours, minutes, or seconds)."
