    "# Reflection on CSP Collegeboard Exam Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "During my recent CSP Collegeboard Exam, I encountered several questions that challenged my understanding and analytical skills. I stumbled on certain questions, leading to incorrect answers. Reviewing these mistakes is essential for my growth and improvement in understanding the subject matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## File Size Distribution (Circle Graph):\n",
    "![q1.png](file:///Users/isabelmarilla/Desktop/Screenshot%202023-12-16%20at%2010.50.51%20PM.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Incorrect Answer:** Chose option A (\"Over 75% of the files stored are 1 MB in size or less\").\n",
    "- **Explanation:**My interpretation of the circle graph was flawed, leading to the miscalculation that files up to 1 MB constituted over 75%, while it actually comprised 66%. I limited myself too much on these options. \n",
    "- **Personal Reflection:** I realize the significance of accurately interpreting data representations like graphs. Improving my graph interpretation skills will be pivotal for future assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Certificate Authority's Role:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Incorrect Answer:** Chose option A (\"A certificate authority certifies the safety of a particular Web site so that users know that it does not contain any viruses\").\n",
    "- **Explanation:** I misunderstood the role of a certificate authority, assuming it directly ensures website safety rather than focusing on authentication and encryption. I forgot about certifcate uthority from the previous team teaching. \n",
    "- **Personal Reflection:** Strengthening my understanding of cybersecurity concepts, especially regarding the functions of certificate authorities, is crucial for more accurate responses. I will have to review the Internet concept of Collegeboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Minimum Bits Required for Binary Sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Incorrect Answer:** Chose option A (\"5\").\n",
    "- **Explanation:** Underestimated the necessary number of bits, limiting the representation to 32 staff members instead of the required 100.\n",
    "- **Personal Reflection:** Reviewing and practicing binary sequence representation is imperative to accurately address larger quantities, ensuring precise calculations. I know how to convert binary to decimal (remainders) and decimal to binary, but I didn't consider combinations in binary. I will need to refresh that. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Execution Times of Program Versions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Incorrect Answer:** Chose option C (\"Version II requires approximately 1 more minute to execute than version I\").\n",
    "- **Explanation:** Misjudged the number of times GetPrediction was called in both versions, resulting in an inaccurate estimation of execution time.\n",
    "- **Personal Reflection:** Enhancing my attention to logic and operations within code snippets is crucial, especially when comparing execution times of different algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Redundant Routing in Network Configurations:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Incorrect Answer:** Chose option A (\"Configuration I only\").\n",
    "- **Explanation:** Failed to recognize that both configurations could support redundant routing between devices Q and V.\n",
    "- **Personal Reflection:** Careful analysis of network configurations is essential to identify potential redundancies between specified devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiplication Procedure's Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Incorrect Answer:** Didn't select option D (\"The figure presents a line of code. Line 1: [begin block] Multiply [begin block] −2, −5 [end block] [end block]\").\n",
    "- **Explanation:** Overlooked the impact of a negative initial value for y, resulting in an incorrect output.\n",
    "- **Personal Reflection:** Understanding how initial values and loop conditions affect iterative procedures, especially with negative values, requires focused practice and comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflecting on these mistakes highlights the areas I need to focus on. Improving interpretation skills for different data representations, reinforcing core concepts, analyzing code or network structures meticulously, and ensuring accuracy in calculations are crucial for my growth. I aim to practice similar problems and concepts thoroughly to excel in future assessments.\n",
