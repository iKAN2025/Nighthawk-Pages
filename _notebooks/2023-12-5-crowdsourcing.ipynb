    "Crowdsourcing is a method of obtaining information, ideas, services, or content by soliciting contributions from a large group of people, particularly from an online community, rather than from traditional employees or suppliers. This approach leverages the collective intelligence and skills of a vast, diverse crowd to solve problems, generate ideas, and complete tasks.\n",

    "Definition: Crowdsourcing combines the words \"crowd\" and \"outsourcing.\" It was first coined by Jeff Howe in a 2006 Wired magazine article. The concept is based on the idea that a large group of people can collectively contribute more diverse and substantial input than an individual or small team."
