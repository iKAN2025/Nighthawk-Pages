    "# What I  Did\n",
    "I worked on a variety of aspects for the CPT Project: Login/Register features, JWT Token implementation(with Justin), Exercise/Sleep Tracking, and (one of my favorites) creating Ascii Profiles for users (with Vibha). Exercise/Sleep, however, were my main features. I create exercise and sleep as columns in my database, then used crud operations to GET/UPDATE information. First I would leave both features as null, then keep updating. Then I would fetch the old data, if there was any, and append it to array of nested JSON. I also needed the JSON response from the login to update to the correct user id and name. I also used a script source to make graphs on my code based on data from the database for each user(which I had to extract from nested json).\n"

    "A great example of this is when I used Javascript Promise Structure the get  data from my form and update the backend. I also had to use an event listener. There are other ways to do this, such as <form action=\"your_action_url\" method=\"POST\">. However, I had to make sure the data was formatted a specific way (according to the requirements outlined in model.py, which  was my teacher's code) and the Javascript Promise structure was more easy for me to work with because I had to update \"all the data\" (according to the def update in backend, so I had to resend the data back. ) I also did this in my last full stack project in first trimester. \n",
