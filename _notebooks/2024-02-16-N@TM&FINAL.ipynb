    "# What I  Did\n",
    "I worked on a variety of aspects with my team for the CPT Project: Login/Register features, JWT Token implementation(with Justin), Exercise/Sleep Tracking, and  creating Ascii Profiles for users (with Vibha). Exercise/Sleep, however, were my main features. I create exercise and sleep as columns in my database, then used crud operations to GET/UPDATE information. First I would leave both features as null, then keep updating. Then I would fetch the old data, if there was any, and append it to array of nested JSON. I also needed the JSON response from the login to update to the correct user id and name. I also used a script source to make graphs on my code based on data from the database for each user(which I had to extract from nested json).\n"
