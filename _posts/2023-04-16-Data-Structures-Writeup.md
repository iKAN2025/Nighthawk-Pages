# Lists  and Dictionaries

Lists 
Blog Python API code and use of List and Dictionaries.
In VSCode using Debugger, show a list as extracted from database as Python objects. Show two distinct example examples of dictionaries, show Keys/Values using debugger.

UPDATE

Discuss algorithmic condition used to direct request to appropriate Python method based on request method.
The classes correspond to certain resource, which all have methods that correspond to CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE). Each class a certain link that cooresponsds to the link that the data is fetched from(either data is fetched or appended or created based on the method)


In VSCode, show algorithmic conditions used to validate data on a POST condition.
