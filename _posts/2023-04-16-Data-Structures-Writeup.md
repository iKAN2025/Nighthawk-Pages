Discuss algorithmic condition used to direct request to appropriate Python method based on request method.
The classes correspond to certain resource, which all have methods that correspond to CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE). Each class a certain link that cooresponsds to the link that the data is fetched from(either data is fetched or appended or created based on the method)


In VSCode, show algorithmic conditions used to validate data on a POST condition.
