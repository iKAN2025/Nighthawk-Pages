# Reflection on glows/grows from your demo
Glows-Most of our stuff working. They were impressed by our login/sign-up capability (one key checkpoint for our project). Our UI was pretty clean overall, and my data was captured for graphs. We could organize it more (the - were not that great, but they were okay)
Grows
More User-User interaction
Chatbots
We could upload profile photos with frontend/backend, but we did profiles in local storage.  

# From feedback, something you will add to individual CPT project
 
We could add a coin system for exercise/sleeping specifically  and put in the backend/generate a leaderboard based on it

# Visuals or pics of team and people you talked

Grace Wang [Feature 3 Java backend, API Integration]
Aliya Tang [Feature 2 Password Strength]
Vivian Ni [Feature 1 Spot the difference]
Emma Shen [Feature 3 Filter cybersecurity news by topic]
Teaching people of all ages about cybersecurity is essential given the increasingly digital nature of our lives and the growing threats in the online space. I found their leader board interesting and I liked how they used multiple APIS to make their site interesting. I also liked how their site was related to CSP.  I was really impressed with their work.

Something you saw outside of CompSci that you liked

I really liked the quality of the photos(especially the one with the building) I also saw some cool ceramics pieces as well, which were very creative.
