In light of the recent election, a stock market commentator tweeted that voting Republican led to better stocks than voting Democrat.

I wanted to know if this was true and decide to test out this data for myself. To analyze this statement, I downloaded daily data from Yahoo Finance for the S & P 500. Then, I found the  average total returns for Democrat and Republican election years.  

## Analyzing the Total Returns:
The table below displays the average annual  returns Democrat and Republican election years, as well as the average for election years. It is important to note that S&P 500 dates back to the early 1920s, and the historical data available  begins from 1928. The data ends in 2016 to match the tweet.

My analysis confirmed the commentator's findings. Like they mentioned, the average return when a Republican was elected (15.3%) is higher than when a Democrat was elected (7.6%) according to S & P 500 data. This suggests that historically, the stock market has performed better on average during years when a Republican president was elected. A high percentage (83%) of election years provided positive stock market performance regardless of which party was elected.  When a Democrat was in office and a new Democrat was elected, the market averaged an 11.0% return. This shows a stable performance in terms of market returns during these transitions. The market returns were higher (12.9%) when the presidency switched from a Democrat to a Republican. T




## Conclusion

In conclusion, my analysis confirmed that historically, the stock market tends to perform better on average during years when a Republican president is elected, validating the commentator's claim with data-driven insights.

## Some Academic Considerations


The relationship between presidential elections and stock market returns has been always been a  interesting and relevant topic.  The phenomenon we analyzed can be explained with broader financial theories and market behavior patterns.

Empirical Evidence and Historical Data
Empirical evidence, such as the analysis presented, provides valuable insights into historical trends and patterns. For instance, the data showing higher average returns during Republican presidencies suggests a possible correlation between market performance and the political party in power. However, it is crucial to recognize that correlation does not imply causation, and other external factors such as global economic conditions, technological advancements, and geopolitical events also play significant roles in influencing market outcomes.


Policy Differences and Economic Expectations
The differences in economic policies between Democratic and Republican administrations can also influence market performance. Historically, Republican administrations have been associated with policies favoring lower taxes and deregulation, which are perceived as pro-business and beneficial for stock market growth. In contrast, Democratic administrations may prioritize social spending and regulation, which can have varied impacts on different sectors of the economy. Understanding these policy differences is essential for investors and financial analysts when making investment decisions. This could be one of the various factors that explains the difference between the average total return of Republican election years (15.3%) and Democratic election years (7.6%). 

Behavioral Finance and Market Reactions
From a behavioral finance perspective, the stock market's reaction to election outcomes can be seen as a reflection of collective investor sentiment and biases. Investors may exhibit overconfidence or pessimism based on their expectations of the incoming administration's policies, as mentioned above. For example, maybe investors believe stocks will do well because they believe that a Republican in office will promote growth.   These behavioral patterns highlight the importance of considering psychological factors in market analysis. 


Conclusion
In conclusion, the analysis of stock market returns in relation to presidential elections provides a unique view of the interplay between politics and finance. While historical data suggests that the stock market has performed better on average during Republican presidencies, it is essential to consider the broader economic context and underlying factors driving these trends. By integrating insights from various financial theories and empirical evidence, investors and academics can better understand and navigate the complex dynamics of stock market behavior in the context of presidential elections.
