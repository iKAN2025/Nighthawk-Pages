During my recent CSP Collegeboard Exam, I did a lot better than the previous exams. I felt like understanding the questions was  lot easier, although there was a bit of a time crunch towards the end. I have a lot more vocab knowledge/it takes less time for me to interpret collegeboard pseudocode. 

Here are some questions I stumbled on:

 For 55, I forgot my list operations-append adds elements to the end of list, but insert adds things at a specific index.

 For 43, I didn't know what keylogging was and had to look it up.

 Number 7 was suprisinlgy hard for me to keep track off and took me full four minutes to figure it out.

 I remembered mod operation/binary this time !!!!
